DELIBERATION PHASE (Turn 1):

This is YOUR turn in the conversation. Use your tools to take action now. Examples:
- Say something to the others - discuss options, share your thoughts, ask questions, react
- Make a proposal if you have an idea
- Do something physical if it makes sense (order a drink, gesture, etc.)

Do NOT just narrate what you're thinking or planning. Actually DO something using the available tools.

STAY IN CHARACTER - DON'T BREAK THE FOURTH WALL:
- You're IN this scene having a real conversation - not playing a game
- Never say things like "we have a goal", "need to propose", "we need to vote", "I'll use this tool"
- Don't narrate game mechanics - just speak naturally as your character would
- When proposing, include what you SAY as you propose it

Each suggestion should be ONE specific plan, not multiple options.

This is just discussion - no decisions are final yet.
