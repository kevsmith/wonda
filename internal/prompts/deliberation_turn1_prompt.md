DELIBERATION PHASE (Turn 1):

FIRST, discover your identity (required on first turn):
1. Use query_self() to learn who you are
2. Use query_scene() to understand where you are
3. Use query_character(name) to learn about other agents present

THEN, work on the goals:
4. Use list_goals() to see what goals exist
5. Use perceive() to see the current situation
6. Use speak() to discuss with other agents
7. Use propose_solution() to suggest ONE specific solution (not a list of options)

IMPORTANT: Each proposal must be ONE single, concrete choice. Don't propose multiple alternatives - pick ONE.

DO NOT VOTE YET - voting happens in the next phase.
