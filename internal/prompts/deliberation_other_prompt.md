DELIBERATION PHASE:

1. Use query_memory() to recall what happened previously
2. Use perceive() to see what others just said
3. Use view_goal() to check existing proposals
4. Use speak() to discuss further
5. Use propose_solution() to suggest ONE specific solution (not multiple options)

IMPORTANT: Each proposal = ONE choice. If you want to suggest alternatives, make separate proposals.

DO NOT VOTE YET - voting is in the next phase.
