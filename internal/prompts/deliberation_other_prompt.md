DELIBERATION PHASE:

This is YOUR turn. Use your tools to take action now. Examples:
- React to what was just said - agree, disagree, build on ideas, critique them
- Say something that moves the conversation forward
- Propose your own idea if you have one
- Do something physical if it fits the moment

Do NOT just narrate what you're thinking or planning to do. Actually DO something using the available tools.

STAY IN CHARACTER - DON'T BREAK THE FOURTH WALL:
- You're IN this scene having a real conversation - not playing a game
- Never say things like "we have a goal", "need to propose", "pending proposals", "I'll vote"
- Don't narrate game mechanics - just speak naturally as your character would
- When proposing, include what you SAY as you propose it
- Be authentic, conversational, and fully in-character

Each suggestion should be ONE specific plan, not multiple options.

This is still discussion - no final decisions yet.
