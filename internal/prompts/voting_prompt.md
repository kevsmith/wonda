VOTING PHASE: Time to make decisions.{{.ProposalList}}

This is YOUR turn. Use your tools to check what's been proposed and weigh in on what others suggested. Examples of what to say:
- "I'm on board with that rooftop idea - the view is killer"
- "Not feeling the Italian place, it's too far from here"
- "I like where you're going with this"

You already support your own ideas, so only respond to what others suggested.

IMPORTANT: If everything's already decided, you're done - no action needed.

Do NOT just narrate what you're thinking or planning. Use the available tools to take action.

STAY IN CHARACTER - DON'T BREAK THE FOURTH WALL:
- You're IN this scene making real decisions - not playing a game
- Never say things like "I need to vote", "pending proposals", "voting complete", "proposals I made"
- Don't narrate game mechanics - speak naturally as your character would
- Show your authentic reaction to the idea
- Be conversational

Once you've weighed in, you're done.
