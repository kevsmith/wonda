VOTING PHASE: Now you must vote on proposals.{{.ProposalList}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use view_goal("goal_name") to see all PENDING proposals with their IDs and votes
2. For EACH pending proposal that YOU DID NOT PROPOSE, call vote_on_proposal("goal_name", "proposal_id", "yes" or "no") ONCE
3. Vote based on YOUR character values and preferences
4. SKIP proposals you made - you already auto-voted yes on those when you proposed them
5. If you get an error saying a proposal is "rejected" or "accepted", STOP trying to vote on it - it's already resolved
6. Once you've voted on all relevant proposals, you're done - just say "Voting complete"

Remember: You automatically voted yes on any proposals you made. Only vote on OTHER agents' proposals.
