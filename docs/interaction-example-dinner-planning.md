[initial_state.environment]
time = "5:30 PM"
setting = "casual"

[initial_state.agent_positions]
Alex = "coffee_shop"
Jordan = "coffee_shop"
```

## Agent Instantiation

### Agent 1: Alex
```toml
agent_id = "agent_001"
character = "Alex"
llm_provider = "http://localhost:11434"  # Ollama
model = "llama3.1:8b"
temperature = 0.7  # More creative responses
```

### Agent 2: Jordan
```toml
agent_id = "agent_002"
character = "Jordan"
llm_provider = "http://localhost:11434"  # Ollama
model = "llama3.1:8b"
temperature = 0.3  # More consistent/practical responses
```

## Simulation Initialization

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```
[Environment] Creating scene state
  - Location: coffee_shop
  - Time: 5:30 PM
  - Mode: NARRATIVE

[Environment] Placing agents
  - agent_001 (Alex) → coffee_shop
  - agent_002 (Jordan) → coffee_shop

[Goal Monitor] Registering goals
  - Goal #1: "Agree on restaurant" (priority 1)
    Assigned to: [Alex, Jordan]
    Current progress: 0.0
```

### Step 2: Agent Initialization
```
[Agent Manager] Instantiating agent_001 (Alex)
  - Loading character definition
  - Connecting to LLM: localhost:11434/llama3.1:8b
  - Initializing state:
    * Position: coffee_shop
    * Condition: 100
    * Emotion: neutral (5/10)
    * Focus: null
    * Certainty: 1.0
  - Loading goals: [Goal #1]
  - Creating RAG memory namespace: agent_001_sim_dinner_plans

[Agent Manager] Instantiating agent_002 (Jordan)
  - Loading character definition
  - Connecting to LLM: localhost:11434/llama3.1:8b
  - Initializing state:
    * Position: coffee_shop
    * Condition: 100
    * Emotion: neutral (5/10)
    * Focus: null
    * Certainty: 1.0
  - Loading goals: [Goal #1]
  - Creating RAG memory namespace: agent_002_sim_dinner_plans
```

### Step 3: Initiative Determination
```
[Simulation] Mode: NARRATIVE
[Simulation] Turn order: Flexible, starting with Alex
```

SCENE: Coffee Shop - 5:30 PM

Alex leaned forward with excitement. "Hey! So I've been dying to try that new Mediterranean place that opened downtown—Olive & Thyme. I heard they have this amazing grilled octopus and everything's super fresh. Plus it's supposed to be really healthy. What do you think?"

Jordan considered this carefully. "Mediterranean sounds nice, but I don't know... how expensive is it? And downtown—isn't parking a nightmare there? What about that Italian place on Maple Street we've been to before? I know it's good and it's pretty affordable."

Alex nodded, acknowledging the concerns. "You make good points about the parking. How about this—what if we try Olive & Thyme tonight since it's early and parking might be easier, and if it's too expensive we can stick with Maple Street in the future? Or, honestly, Maple Street is great too. Which would make you happier?"

Jordan smiled. "You know what, you're right—it is early so parking should be okay. And if it's too pricey we can just keep it in mind for special occasions. Let's try Olive & Thyme. I'm curious about that octopus now!"

OUTCOME: Agreement reached - Olive & Thyme restaurant

## System Interactions Summary

This example demonstrates:

1. **MCP Server Interface**:
   - Perception queries (observe_scene)
   - Communication (speak)
   - Memory queries (recall_interactions, recall_facts)

2. **Agent Architecture**:
   - Character traits influencing LLM behavior
   - State tracking (emotion, focus, certainty)
   - Temperature differences (0.7 vs 0.3) affecting response style

3. **Memory System**:
   - Formation of episodic memories
   - Retrieval of prior interactions
   - Importance scoring based on goal relevance

4. **Goal Monitoring**:
   - Continuous progress evaluation
   - Agreement detection
   - Scenario completion trigger

5. **Narrative Mode**:
   - Flexible turn-taking
   - Dialogue-heavy interaction
   - No strict action economy

6. **Event System**:
   - Speech events propagating between agents
   - State changes tracked
   - Observable-by filtering
